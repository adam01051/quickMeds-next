# Completed Tasks

## Session Summary

This session completed the repository audit and safe rename layer for the Nestar to quickMeds migration. The work intentionally avoided business-domain changes, GraphQL contract changes, MongoDB collection changes, and schema migrations.

## Completed Refactors

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Repository migration audit | Completed | Identified real-estate-specific backend modules, DTOs, enums, GraphQL surfaces, Mongo schemas, and labels. |
| Safe rename plan | Completed | Defined project/app rename scope and explicit non-changes. |
| Package rename | Completed | `package.json` and `package-lock.json` use `quickmeds`. |
| Nest app folder rename | Completed | `apps/nestar-api` -> `apps/quickmeds-api`; `apps/nestar-batch` -> `apps/quickmeds-batch`. |
| Nest project key rename | Completed | `nest-cli.json` uses `quickmeds-api` and `quickmeds-batch`. |
| Build output path update | Completed | App `tsconfig.app.json` files output to `dist/apps/quickmeds-*`. |
| Script path update | Completed | npm scripts now reference quickMeds app paths/project keys. |
| Absolute import update | Completed | Imports from `apps/nestar-api/...` were updated to `apps/quickmeds-api/...`. |
| Runtime label update | Completed | API and batch welcome strings now say quickMeds. |
| Environment app label update | Completed | `.env` Mongo URI `appName` label changed to `quickMeds`; host/path unchanged. |
| Lint-only cleanup | Completed | Removed one unused import and one unused method parameter surfaced by lint. |
| Full property-to-pharmacy backend migration | Completed | Replaced Property APIs, DTOs, schema, model, collection, shared social groups, member counter, and batch ranking with Pharmacy terminology. |

## Changed Areas

| Area | Files/modules |
| --- | --- |
| Package metadata | `package.json`, `package-lock.json` |
| Nest workspace config | `nest-cli.json` |

| Batch app | `apps/quickmeds-batch` |
| Runtime labels | `app.resolver.ts`, `app.service.ts`, `batch.service.ts` |
| Cross-app imports | Batch module/service imports and auth guard absolute imports |
| Environment label | `.env` |
| Lint cleanup | `Notice.model.ts`, `socket.gateway.ts` |
| Pharmacy domain migration | `PharmacyModule`, `PharmacyService`, `PharmacyResolver`, pharmacy DTOs/enums/schema, social modules, member counter, batch app |

## Validation Status

| Validation | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Old-name source scan | `rg -n -i "nestar|Nestar" --hidden --glob '!node_modules/**' --glob '!dist/**' --glob '!.git/**' .` | Passed after safe rename. |
| Lint | `npm run lint` | Passed. |
| Main build/typecheck | `npm run build` | Passed. |

| Pharmacy service focused spec | `npx jest apps/quickmeds-api/src/components/pharmacy/pharmacy.service.spec.ts --runInBand` | Passed. |
| Full build after pharmacy migration | `npm run build` | Passed. |

## Explicitly Not Changed

| Not changed | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| `MemberType.USER`, `MemberType.AGENT`, `MemberType.ADMIN` | User requested member types remain unchanged. |
| Existing MongoDB data backfill | Requires a separate production migration plan. |
| Board article to health article rename | Outside this property-to-pharmacy phase. |

## Frontend Pharmacy Migration

The `quickMeds-next` frontend was migrated from the removed property GraphQL contract to the current pharmacy backend contract while preserving the existing Pages Router, Apollo integration, routes, and SCSS architecture.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend pharmacy GraphQL migration | Completed | Replaced property operations and member property counters with pharmacy operations and `memberPharmacies`. |
| Pharmacy frontend types and enums | Completed | Added backend-aligned pharmacy types, statuses, locations, filters, inputs, and updates. |
| Public pharmacy catalog | Completed | Migrated catalog, detail, favorites, visited, homepage cards, likes, comments, and filters to pharmacy fields. |
| Pharmacy owner workflows | Completed | Kept `MemberType.AGENT` internally and changed visible terminology to Pharmacy Owner. |
| Owner pharmacy management | Completed | Migrated create, edit, status, image upload, and owner pharmacy list workflows. |
| Admin pharmacy management | Completed | Migrated admin queries, mutations, filters, statuses, and table content. |
| Branding and UI terminology | Completed | Updated visible Nestar and real-estate copy to quickMeds/pharmacy terminology while preserving route and SCSS compatibility. |
| Assets and layout cleanup | Completed | Removed the floor-plan UI and replaced obvious property fact icons with neutral catalog/service icons. |

## Frontend Validation

| Validation | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend typecheck | `yarn typecheck --pretty false` | Passed. |
| Frontend production build | `yarn build` | Passed; all 73 static pages generated. |
| Live backend schema check | GraphQL introspection at `http://localhost:3007/graphql` | Passed; pharmacy query and mutation operations confirmed. |
| Live pharmacy catalog smoke query | `getPharmacies` with current pharmacy/member fields | Passed; returned an active pharmacy. |
| Served frontend smoke check | `http://localhost:3000/property` | Passed; returned quickMeds Pharmacy Search and pharmacy catalog content. |
| Stale GraphQL contract scan | Search for removed property operations, fields, and `PROPERTY` social groups | Passed. |
| Frontend lint | `yarn lint` | Blocked because the repository has no ESLint configuration and Next.js opens an interactive setup prompt. |
| In-app browser smoke test | In-app Browser connection | Blocked because no in-app browser session was available; HTTP smoke checks passed instead. |

## Frontend Original-Style Restoration

The original Nestar desktop visual structure was restored without reverting the quickMeds pharmacy contract, branding, routes, or neutral assets.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage search restoration | Completed | Restored the original search bar, dropdown panels, advanced-filter modal, and circular search action with pharmacy filters. |
| Catalog sidebar restoration | Completed | Restored the original nested filter layout with pharmacy location, type, delivery, insurance, delivery fee, search, and reset controls. |
| Pharmacy editor restoration | Completed | Restored the original form rows, styled controls, upload panel, gallery, and save action around current pharmacy fields. |
| Cross-page visual cleanup | Completed | Restored wordmark sizing and replaced duplicated pharmacy facts with distinct medication, type, and location details. |
| SCSS compatibility | Completed | Preserved existing class names and SCSS architecture, adding only narrow pharmacy-specific adapters. |
| Pharmacy logic audit | Completed | Confirmed restored components contain no removed property GraphQL operations or property-only fields. |

## Frontend Style Restoration Validation

| Validation | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend typecheck | `yarn typecheck --pretty false` | Passed. |
| Frontend production build | `yarn build` | Passed; all 73 static pages generated. |
| Diff whitespace check | `git diff --check` | Passed. |
| Served route checks | `/`, `/property`, `/mypage`, `/_admin/properties` | Passed; each returned HTTP 200. |
| Restored layout hook check | Served HTML and SCSS selector inspection | Passed; original search, filter, form, and wordmark hooks are present. |
| Property logic regression scan | Search for removed property operations and fields in restored components | Passed. |
| In-app visual browser | In-app Browser connection | Blocked because no in-app browser session was available; served route and layout-hook checks passed instead. |

## Canonical Public Pharmacy Routes

The public pharmacy catalog now uses pharmacy terminology in its canonical URLs while preserving old bookmarks.

| Task | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public catalog route | Completed | Moved the pharmacy catalog from `/property` to `/pharmacies`. |
| Public detail route | Completed | Moved pharmacy details from `/property/detail` to `/pharmacies/detail`. |
| Legacy compatibility | Completed | Added permanent redirects from both old routes and preserved query parameters. |
| Route consumers | Completed | Updated navigation, homepage search, filters, cards, favorites, owner pages, and admin detail links. |
| Deferred internal cleanup | Documented | Legacy component, type, SCSS, admin-route, and owner-category names remain for a separate incremental migration. |
