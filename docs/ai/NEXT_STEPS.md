# Next Steps

## Priority Order

1. Plan MongoDB data migration from old property-era documents to pharmacy-era documents if existing data must be preserved.
2. Inventory the Next.js frontend repo and update GraphQL operations to the new pharmacy API.
3. Add focused GraphQL smoke tests for pharmacy create/search/update/like/favorites/visited.
4. Decide whether board articles should become health articles in a later phase.

## Backend Cleanup

| Priority | Task | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Add pharmacy smoke tests | Cover `createPharmacy`, `getPharmacy`, `getPharmacies`, `updatePharmacy`, `likeTargetPharmacy`, favorites, and visited. |
| P0 | Plan MongoDB backfill | Map `properties` to `pharmacies`, `memberProperties` to `memberPharmacies`, and social `PROPERTY` groups to `PHARMACY`. |
| P1 | Add migration runbook | Include backup, dry-run, backfill, rollback, and verification queries. |
| P1 | Review pharmacy filters | Confirm `pharmacyLocation`, delivery, insurance, and text filters match frontend requirements. |
| P2 | Consider health article migration | ER model includes health articles, while backend still has board articles. |

## Frontend Migration

| Priority | Task | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Replace old Property GraphQL calls | Use `createPharmacy`, `getPharmacy`, `getPharmacies`, `getAgentPharmacies`, and admin pharmacy operations. |
| P0 | Regenerate GraphQL types | Old `Property*` types are removed by the breaking backend rename. |
| P1 | Migrate route labels and navigation | Replace property/agent language with pharmacy owner/pharmacy terminology. |
| P1 | Migrate pharmacy cards/detail forms | Use pharmacy name, address, type, delivery fee, medication count, insurance, delivery, images, and description. |

## Validation

| Priority | Task | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | Keep TypeScript checks in migration checklist | `npx tsc -p apps/quickmeds-api/tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` and batch equivalent. |
| P0 | Keep build check | Run `npm run build` after implementation work. |
| P1 | Add e2e smoke tests | Cover pharmacy catalog, pharmacy detail, saved pharmacies, and owner pharmacy pages. |
